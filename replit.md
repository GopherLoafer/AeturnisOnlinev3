- June 29, 2025: **Critical Character Creation Bug Fixed**

  - **Root Cause**: calculateStartingStats() function only applied race/background bonuses, ignored player's stat allocation
  - **Solution**: Modified calculateStartingStats() to accept and apply statAllocation parameter from session data
  - **Impact**: Characters now receive all intended stat points (base + race + background + allocated)
  - **Database Fix**: Updated existing test character with correct stat values

  - **Tested & Verified**: Successfully storing and calculating with values up to 923 quintillion+
- June 29, 2025: **Critical BigInt Overflow Issue Discovered**
  - **Overflow at Level 248**: Current compound growth formula causes PostgreSQL BIGINT overflow far too early
  - **Simple Formula Alternative**: `100 * level^2.5 + level * 50` would allow 6+ million levels
  - **Immediate Action Required**: Must implement overflow prevention before players reach level 248
