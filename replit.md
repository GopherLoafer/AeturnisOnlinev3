## Project Overview
A classic text-based MMORPG with infinite progression, racial diversity, and affinity-based combat systems. Built following systematic phase-based development approach from Phases.md specifications.

## Current Status
- **Phase 1.1 Project Architecture Setup**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Implementation**: Full backend and frontend architecture established
- **Server Status**: Running successfully on port 5000
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with 8 races and complete schema

## Architecture Overview

### Backend Structure
- Express.js server with comprehensive middleware stack
- PostgreSQL database with relational schema design
- Authentication system with session management
- Rate limiting and security hardening
- Modular route organization (auth, game, admin)

### Frontend Structure
- EJS templating with dark theme matching UIMOCKUP.png
- Responsive grid-based game interface
- Character creation with race selection
- Game dashboard with stats, inventory, and chat
- Mobile-responsive design

### Database Schema
- Complete user management with authentication
- 8 unique races with stat modifiers and starting zones
- Character system with infinite level progression
- Weapon affinity tracking (7 weapon types)
- Magic affinity tracking (8 magic schools)
- Session management and chat systems
- Admin action logging

## Phase 1.1 Implementation Complete

### ✅ Repository Structure
- `/src/` - Backend application logic
- `/views/` - EJS templates organized by feature
- `/public/` - Static assets (CSS, JavaScript)

### ✅ Technology Stack
- Node.js 20 with Express.js framework
- PostgreSQL for persistent data storage
- EJS templating engine for server-side rendering
- bcrypt for password security
- Comprehensive middleware stack (helmet, cors, rate limiting)

### ✅ Database Schema
- 8 tables with proper relationships and constraints
- Default races populated with lore-appropriate stats
- Affinity tracking systems for weapons and magic
- Session management and audit logging

### ✅ Authentication System
- Registration with validation and uniqueness checks
