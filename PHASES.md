- **Action Logging**: Show recent admin actions in the interface
- **Quick Access**: Hotkeys for common admin tasks
- **Mobile Support**: Ensure admin tools work on mobile for emergency access
- **Search Everything**: Add search to all admin lists (players, items, etc.)
- **Bulk Operations**: Allow selecting multiple items for efficiency
- **Undo Options**: Provide undo for reversible actions

### Recommended Admin Team Structure
1. **Head Admin** (1-2 people)

### Admin Security Best Practices
- **Separate Admin Accounts**: Admins should have separate player accounts
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Require 2FA for all admin accounts
- **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict admin panel access to known IPs
- **Action Audit Logs**: Log every admin action with timestamp and reason
- **Regular Audits**: Review admin actions weekly
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Give minimum necessary permissions
- **Time-Limited Access**: Rotate admin credentials regularly
- **Emergency Procedures**: Have a plan for compromised admin accounts

## Key Dependencies Between Phases

1. **Phase 1 → Phase 2**: Need server before authentication
2. **Phase 2 → Phase 3**: Need users before characters (admin roles critical here)
3. **Phase 3 → Phase 4**: Need characters before movement
4. **Phase 4 → Phase 5**: Need movement before combat
5. **Phase 5 → Phase 6**: Need combat for item drops
6. **Phase 6 → Phase 7**: Need items before trading
7. **All Phases → Phase 8**: Everything must work before launch

**Critical Admin Dependencies:**
- Admin role system (Phase 2) required for ALL subsequent admin tools
- Admin authentication must be extra secure (separate 2FA recommended)
- Admin actions should be logged from Phase 2 onward
- Each phase's admin tools depend on core feature working first
